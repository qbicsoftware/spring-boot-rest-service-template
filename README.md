# REST web service with Spring Boot

Functional example for a Http REST service with Spring Boot. Since this is 
a [Github repository template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template), create a new application based on this repo and start your project directly.

## Endpoints

Default configuration binds on local port 8080.

```
/projects/{id}
```

Working identifiers are `QTEST` and `QABCD`.
